# OrganizationTools
Here you can find the simple python codes I use in order to **organize myself** and my daily routines: in fact I developed this [web application](https://organizationtools.streamlit.app/), and with this repository you can **analize the source code**.

You can use this programs to:
- Understand how much you have to work in order to **reach a predifined goal**.
- Create a **study plan** (you can as well use this web app for work, obviously).
- **Define a realistical objective**.

I hope you'll find this codes useful, and don't hesitate to reach me via email (*nicola.chimenti.work@gmail.com*) if you have any problem or question!
