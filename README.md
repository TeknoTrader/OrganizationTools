# OrganizationTools
Here you can find the simple python codes I use in order to **organize myself** and my daily routines.

You can use this programs to:
- Understand how much you have to work to **reach a predifined goal**
- Create a **study plan**
- **Define a goal**, if you don't have one

I hope you'll find this codes useful, and don't hesitate to reach me via email (*nicola.chimenti.work@gmail.com*) if you have any problem or question!
